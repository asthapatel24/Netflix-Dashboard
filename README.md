# Netflix Data Visualization 

### To Start on this Dashboard

- Download the data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
- I have created the table from this data in google big query and then I have created the visulization by conecting google big query server to Tableau
- You can start directly by using this CSV also in Tableau. In Connect option you can find the text option to create the data source from CSV file
- Once the data source is created you can start making relevant grahs and analysis from it 
- The measure value in data is only the number of count therefore possible visualization from the data can be having the same measure against various dimensions
